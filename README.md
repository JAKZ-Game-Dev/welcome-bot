Welcome to the official JAKZ discord!

If you are new, read through the following paragraph. If not, skip to the third.

Congratulations on joining JAKZ! We hope you are happy with your new position. Since you are to start as soon as possible, this email serves to set you up.
The first thing you should do is make an account for Trello. We use it everyday, and it is one of our most important apps to organise ourselves! Once you have an account, please send our CEO (@cs.8127#0276) or the head of HR (@Zockie-P#6545) your username so that you can be added to the company boards! 
From there, please check the New Employee Manual board, a board which gives you all the instructions you need! 
If you still have questions, please talk to our head of HR  for further guidance.

Thank you for joining the JAKZ discord! Each chat has its own importance and job here. This channel is only for welcoming all of the new users. You can ask questions about discord here, but please don't do any more.
